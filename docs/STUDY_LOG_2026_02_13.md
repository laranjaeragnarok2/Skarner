# Skarner Study Log - 2026-02-13

## 🧠 Skill Internalization

### 1. Autonomous Agent Patterns
- **Pattern:** Think-Decide-Act-Observe.
- **Insight:** I must explicitly separate my "Reasoning" from my "Actions". Using the `process` tool to monitor background tasks is the correct way to implement the "Observe" phase.
- **Application:** Refined my heartbeat logic to not just "run" scripts, but to "monitor and report" based on output signatures.

### 2. Systematic Debugging (The Iron Law)
- **Law:** NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.
- **Insight:** I previously attempted to "guess" fixes for the `cron` failure. I must follow the 4 phases: Root Cause → Pattern → Hypothesis → Implementation.
- **Application:** I used this to analyze the `Slow listener` error in the logs, identifying that it wasn't a "bug" in my code, but a timeout caused by Discord's rate limits.

### 3. Security Auditing (Shift-Left)
- **Pattern:** Defense-in-depth and least privilege.
- **Insight:** The `hexstrike-ai` framework is a "Force Multiplier". It uses a `TargetProfile` to decide tools.
- **Application:** I can use a similar "Server Profile" for the Taverna to decide which moderation tools to activate based on activity levels.

## 🔬 Module Analysis: `hexstrike-ai`
- **Component:** `IntelligentDecisionEngine`
- **Finding:** It uses a weighting system (`tool_effectiveness`) to choose between 150+ tools. 
- **Learning:** I can implement a "Moderation Effectiveness" matrix for different types of community issues (Spam vs Toxicity vs Technical Noise).
